# How to mount the DK ISO (needs su and assumes the dir /mnt/dk to exist):
mount -o loop /home/julien/Dosbox/dungeon-keeper.iso /mnt/dk

# Given that DK is already installed from ISO to disk in ~/Dosbox/
# we can mount that inside of Dosbox like so:
MOUNT C ~/Dosbox

# We then need to mount the DK CD ROM (see above) like so:
MOUNT D /mnt/dk -t cdrom

# Now let's switch to our Drive C:
C:

# Now go into the DK directory:
cd KEEPER

# Aaand we can finally start up DK:
KEEPER.EXE
